Why It's Important to Activate CCleaner
Activation confirms your purchase and gives you access to all the features of CCleaner Professional or Business editions. It links your license to your machine, which lets you use services like:

Monitoring the system in real time

Cleaning and updating on their own

Customer support that comes first

Extended software tools

If you don't activate, you'll stay on the free version and won't be able to use the premium tools, even if you paid for them.

Before you can use CCleaner, you need:

Before you start the activation procedure, make sure you have the following:

A valid license key that was delivered to you via email after you bought it

The email address or name used to buy it

The most recent version of CCleaner is on your device.

A connection to the internet that works

Make sure you grab the most recent official version of CCleaner from the official source if you haven't already.

Fixing problems with CCleaner activation

If your activation doesn't work, these are the most typical reasons and fixes:

Wrong License Key

When you copy and paste, make sure there are no unnecessary spaces.

Make sure you're using the right license key for the right product and version.

The license key is already in use.

There is a limit to how many times you may install each license. It can get blocked if you've used it on too many devices.

If you want to reset your license or move it to a new device, get in touch with CCleaner customer service.

You need an internet connection.

To activate, you need to be connected to the internet. Look at your network and try again.

If you need to, you can temporarily turn off your firewall or antivirus software to let it work.

License that has run out

You will need to renew your subscription before you can reactivate it if it has expired.

Using an Older Version

To make sure your license key works with CCleaner, you should always download and install the most recent version.

How to Check the Activation Status

To make sure that your CCleaner software is working properly:

Start CCleaner

Go to the "About" or "Options" section

Find a notification that says "Professional Edition" and the date your license will run out.

If it still says "Free," go through the procedures to activate it again.

Taking care of your license

If you need to transfer CCleaner to a different computer:

Remove CCleaner from the old device.

Put it on the new device.

During activation, type in your original license key.

If activation doesn't work because of constraints, get in touch with support to reset your license.

Keep track of how many activations you've used for multi-device licenses so you don't go over the limit.

Tip for Safety: Keep Your License Key Safe

Keep your license email in a safe place.

Don't give your key to anyone else.

To avoid fake versions that could steal your key or personal information, only download from the official CCleaner website.
